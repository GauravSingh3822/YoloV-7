        "\n",
        "If you already have your own images (and, optionally, annotations), you can convert your dataset using Roboflow, a set of tools developers use to build better computer vision models quickly and accurately. 100k+ developers use roboflow for (automatic) annotation, converting dataset formats (like to YOLOv7), training, deploying, and improving their datasets/models.\n",
